# BETTER WEATHER

## Initial Thought Process
I brainstormed on what technologies to use and decided on using React, HTML, CSS.  
  
I wanted to model my weather app half based on how forecast is broadcast on TV and the other half on how weather.com shows it columns and rows.  

I created some hand-drawn wireframes and then decided to model it that way. These designs were based off of an easier to a simplistic and easy to use weather app so older people, like my dad who loves to check the weather, would have an easier time to using it.
