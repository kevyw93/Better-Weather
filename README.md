# BETTER WEATHER

## Initial Thought Process
I brainstormed on what technologies to use and decided on using React, HTML, CSS.  

I wanted to model my weather app half based on how forecast is broadcast on TV and the other half on how weather.com shows it columns and rows.  

I read through the openweathermap api docs to find what type of information I was suppose to render. I chose date, min-temp, max-temp, icon and description.  

I created some hand-drawn wireframes and then decided to model it that way. These designs were based off of an easier to a simplistic and easy to use weather app so older people, like my parents, would have an easier time to using it.  

## Technologies Used
  1. React - create-react-app package
  2. jQuery - imported as a package (used ajax for api calls)
  3. HTML - structured my static page and components
  4. CSS - styled along with media queries
  5. javaScript -
