# BETTER WEATHER

## How To Use  
Hi

## Initial Thought Process
I brainstormed on what technologies to use and decided on using React, HTML, CSS. I decided that I did not need Redux because it was a simple app where I can maintain local state on the top most component.  

I wanted to model my weather app half based on how forecast is broadcast on TV and the other half on how weather.com shows it columns and rows.  

I read through the openweathermap api docs to find what type of information I was suppose to render. I chose date, min-temp, max-temp, icon and description.  

I created some hand-drawn wireframes and then decided to model it that way. These designs were based off of an easier to a simplistic and easy to use weather app so older people, like my parents, would have an easier time to using it.

## Technologies Used
  1. React - create-react-app package
  2. jQuery - imported as a package (used ajax for api calls)
  3. HTML5
  4. CSS3
  5. javaScript

## Structure/Components of App
### App Component
Generated by create-react-app. This component consists of my async function that calls the api function. It also chains the api call to update my local state. My local state consist of a boolean that tells me if I am in loading stage (boolean is updated to false upon fetching json data or if it failed to fetch). The local state also contains weather, current location and input value which is updated on event calls.

### DailyComponent
App Component packages each day json data into strings and passes each into a daily component. This in turns allows me to render the 5 different daily components on the DOM.  
DailyComponent receives, parses and renders a day of the week from App Component as well as temperature, description of the weather and icon.
